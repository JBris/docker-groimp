# groimp-docker

## A Docker container to run GroIMP 1.6 with java 11

#### Due to Oracle's authentication requirement, users need to download the java version by themselves and put into the java folder before running the docker build

#### I need to use docker-compose instead of docker compose on my ubuntu machine
#### I need to add sudo command to run docker on my machine
