# groimp-docker

## A Docker container to run GroIMP 1.6 with java 11
## A docker file is a isolated environment for running specific applications. It can run independently from the local environment. 
## a general workflow for using this docker file is use it as the groimp application, write docker-compose script to map the model, and run the model from a docker compose file (will imporve this later)
## need to add docker compose file example and code example
## need to add ext folder

#### Due to Oracle's authentication requirement, users need to download the java version by themselves and put into the java folder before running the docker build

#### I need to use docker-compose instead of docker compose on my ubuntu machine
#### I need to add sudo command to run docker on my machine
